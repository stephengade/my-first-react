# The Beginning 

This is my first attempt to react.js and I love its simplicity (ðŸ˜Š).

# Previous Knowlegde

I'm good at HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript before I start learning react.js

# Why Learning React?

It's simply because REACT.js has become the most sought after frontend stack adopted by almost all companies and startups in the world; So I'm trying to be active in the tech marketplace.

# Your Next Plan

To master react in 3-4 months, build some projects and then learn <code>Vue.js</code> which is also used with or instead of react by some people. So, I wish to be balanced on the two stacks.
